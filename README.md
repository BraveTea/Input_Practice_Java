# Input_Practice_Java
First practise with Scanner and input. "echo" code and a very basic calculator. I didn't set out to write the calculator which is why the code is not very good. It's an amalgamation of new things I was learning on the fly.



/* I started this file as a way to figure out how Scanner worked and how to get
input from a user.
That "echo" code is down below commented out
After "echo" I thought to make a simple calculator using a switch statement.
I understand that this could be a lot nicer, and normally I would use a while-loop
to keep it going until a stop command is issued in input. But for now I was just
practising with creating methods and seeing how they worked with input and if I could
use methods assigned to a variable. This came about because I wanted to know when
input were being run. I noticed earlier that the code isn't paused for an input.
So all instructions were printed at the same time and then all inputs were asked
(because I wrote the code structurally)
I then proceeded to put the instructions in a method which would be called one at a time
and instructions and input scans were correctly ordered.
